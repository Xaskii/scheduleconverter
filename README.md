# scheduleconverter

Converts "Detailed Schedule" page from Carleton Central to an **icalendar** that you can import

## Setup

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies

In terminal or cmd:

```bash
python3 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

TBD, have to change stuff to not use a file input

## TODO

- [x] Find iCalendar file library
- [x] Parse out paste from Detailed Schedule page
- [x] Solve reoccuring event problem (finally fixed holy)
- [ ] Change into an API then make a front-end

## Notes

- Took longer than doing it manually T_T
